# React JS

## What is React JS?

React js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating interactive, dynamic, and responsive web applications.

### Key Features:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components, which are reusable and self-contained pieces of code that describe parts of the user interface. Components can be nested, managed, and reused across the application.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the actual DOM) to efficiently update the web page. When the state of an object changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then compares it with the actual DOM and only updates the parts that have changed, improving performance.
- **JSX Syntax**: React allows developers to write components using JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, which makes the code more readable and easier to write.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data flow, meaning that data flows from the parent component to child components via props, making it easier to track how data changes throughout the application.
- **State Management**: React allows each component to have its own state, and this state can be used to control dynamic behavior and render updates when the data changes.

## How to Set Up React JS?

### Prerequisite Apps

Before installing React JS, you need to install the following software on your system:
- **Node.js**: React relies on Node.js for package management (NPM/Yarn) and plays a crucial role in the development, build, and deployment processes of React applications. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Code Editor**: A good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for React development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Node.js and NPM**
    - Node.js and npm: React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can check if they are installed by running:
    ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
    ```
    - If they’re not installed, download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.

2. **Install Create React App**
    -  Create React App is a command-line tool that simplifies setting up a React project. Install it globally by running:
    ```bash
        npm create-react-app my-first-react-app
    ```
    - Replace `my-first-react-app` with your desired project name.

3. **Create a New React Project**
    - To start a new React project, use Create React App and specify your project’s name (e.g., "my-app"):
    ```bash
        npx create-react-app my-app
    ```
    - This will create a new directory named `my-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies for a basic React application.

    
4. **Navigate to Your Project**
    - Go into your project’s directory:
    ```bash
        cd my-app
    ```

5. **Start the Development Server**
    - To view the application, start the development server:
    ```bash
        npm start
    ```
    - This command starts a local server and opens the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes you make to the code will automatically refresh in the browser.

5. **Explore the Project Structure**
    - Your new React app has a few important files and folders:

    - `public`: Contains the `index.html` file that loads the React app.
    - `src`: This is where your main React code lives, including `App.js`, the main component.
    - `node_modules`: Contains all the dependencies installed for your project.

6. **Edit Your First Component**
     - Open `src/App.js` in a code editor, make changes to the HTML and JavaScript, and save. You’ll see the changes reflected instantly in the browser.

7. **Build the Project for Production**
    - To create an optimized, production-ready build of your application, use:
     ```bash
        npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `build` folder with all the optimized files needed for deployment.
